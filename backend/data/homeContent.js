      "This is why the target picture also needs to include methods for virtual exploration in a #digitalfirst way – helping OEMs to do market and UX validation as early as possible in the lifecycle of new features and functions. Today, \"shift-left testing\" is well established in the software industry, helping to avoid exponential downstream costs. We want to help establish this also for the automotive industry."

This is a cloud-based, rapid prototyping environment for new, SDV-enabled features. The prototypes are built against real-world vehicle APIs and can be seamlessly migrated to automotive runtimes, such as Eclipse Velocitas. The playground is open and free to use. Try it out, or join our development community at Eclipse.",
